# Fribbledom: Adventures in Go

## What?
I'm watching [Muesli's Go crash course](https://peertube.social/videos/watch/4df0ca9b-dac7-4e9b-aa77-055e07bb837c) writing this, and also going about mucking around with the syntax.

## Build
`go build ...` a single file (`go run ...` also works.) do NOT run `go build` - each file is its own program and that would fail _miserably._
